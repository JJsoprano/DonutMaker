        <p class="project-item-text">
                    Our "Fred the Baker's Donut Maker Clicker" game is a nostalgic tribute to the iconic advertising character,
                    Fred the Baker, from **Dunkin' Donuts**. Portrayed by the late actor **Michael Vale**, Fred was famous
                    for his perpetually sleepy, yet dedicated, demeanor and his classic catchphrase:
                    <strong>"Time to make the donuts!"</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="project-item-text">
                    For 15 years (from 1982 to 1997), Fred symbolized Dunkin' Donuts' commitment to baking fresh donuts
                    every morning, long before dawn. His tireless dedication resonated with millions and made him a beloved
                    cultural icon. This game aims to capture a bit of that simple, hardworking charm as you build your
                    own donut empire!
